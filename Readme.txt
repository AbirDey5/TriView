Getting useful feedback on writing is hard. Real people are busy, and when they do give feedback it usually comes from a single perspective: a nice friend who is too gentle, a strict reviewer who only points out flaws, or an expert who cares only about correctness.

For students, creators, and professionals, this leads to three common problems. First, feedback is slow and you may wait days for someone to reply. Second, feedback is unbalanced and tends to be either overly positive or overwhelmingly negative. Third, feedback is one-dimensional, so you don’t see how different kinds of reviewers would react.

I wanted to build something that behaves more like a real review panel: several people, each with their own role, looking at the same piece of work and then combining their thoughts into a clear plan.

TriView (Multi-Perspective Feedback Coach) aims to give fast, structured feedback on any text from three different perspectives and turn that into an actionable improvement plan.
